The physical segment was where we got more room for creativity. In our concept, the data gathering of the plantâ€™s health is done by a set of sensors that the user can clip on their plant pot. Here we start off with humidity, temperature, and light sensors. In the next step, all sensors get connected to a microcontroller. The design goals of the data gathering system are modularity and re-usability. The user should be able to easily apply the whole system to a new plant pot when he is finished with the learning process of the previous plant. In addition, if a sensor stops working, there should be no need to replace the complete system. Furthermore, this gives us the liberty to develop further modules the user can buy and add later on to his pot, without changing the existing product concept. One example would be a water supply system. This design is shown in the following figure including specified information about its specific components.

After the data is successfully gathered, the micro-controller will send the Data to an application on our user's smartphone. Nowadays, as smartphones and human interactions are improving, the use of an app is the most efficient tool for us in the case of generating knowledge. The fact that our potential target group is tending to be more younger people underlines our decision. This application will build the heart of our approach. Here we will implement a data basis that contains knowledge over a broad distribution of plants and use the gathered data from the sensor kit to create a learning algorithm. Regarding this learning algorithm, we will use active recall, spaced repetition, and feedback for the gain of human knowledge since according to neurological literature these are the most effective ways a brain can transfer information from working memory into long-term memory. In addition, we would like to make all this available to the user in an appealing and intuitive interface in a kind of interactive learning game. Therefore the app will contain a level system for learning, that will periodically deliver more responsibilities and information to the user as well as quizzes and specific information about their plant. Also, through the app, the user will have access to real-time information about the plant in order to remotely monitor its status.
